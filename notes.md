Some good practice using git/github.
Learned about the bash terminal that came with git when I downloaded it. It will absolutely be my new default terminal

# Amazon Web Services - EC2
Nice simple walkthrough of how to start up a webserver using AWS. 
I am glad I very recently remade a bunch of my file/password storage so I had a good place for the RSA file

# HTML

# Startup HTML
After a long time of trying to figure out what was wanted from me from this assignment I think I finally figured it out and did what was wanted. I don't think anything too exciting happened with it... **except** when I acidentally cloned Simon into my repository rather than making it a submodule fixing that was a little bit more work, but we got there in the end :)
